Are you new to AirBnB? Our friend's over at Learn AirBnB put together a [great guide](https://learnairbnb.com/airbnb-hosting-beginners-guide/) for getting started with AirBnB hosting. That's not all though. You'll want to make sure you make a fist great impression. [EasyStay]({{ site.baseurl }}) can help you get your place cleaned regularly, perform your key exchanges with guests, and make sure the fridge is stocked with your guest's favorite refreshing beverage.
